### About me
I am an experienced business side employee. I'm service and quality-oriented person, cooperative and open minded, finding "how-to" solutions and taking responsibility to succeed in projects I'm in charge of. As almost every project has its technical side, I wanted to know how it all works. I wanted to expand my knowledge and I started self learning programming languages. I realized that I was passionate about programming. The feeling when your code finally works after hours of struggling is indescribable. So i decided I want to dig deeper and switch my career to programming.
